    <h1>Support</h1>
    <p>need support? game isnt working? want to request a new tool or game? contact us at <a>prmsmagnet@protonmail.com</a></p>
    <ul><h2>DISCLAIMER:</h2>
        <li>please make it clear what the problem is.. you cant just expect the developer to magically know what your talking about if you email them saying "GAME BROKEN FIX NOW!!!!"</li>
        <li>it would be appreciated to tell the game name, what the problem is, and preferably the link to the game.</li>
        <li>this is an open source website, allowing anyone to modify the site and deploy it for their own. if the deployer changed <a>any</a> code or the site isnt up to date, it is expected the deployer change their code to match their current contact information, because the original developer doesnt want to fix someone else's project. thanks for considering.</li>
        <li>if you want the developer to add a tool or game, please make sure it is PG or PG13 and not innapropiate to school. if your game is declined, feel free to make your own branch of this <a href="https://github.com/PRMS-magnet/web-games">site's repository</a> to add a game</li>
